# Ephys data analysis

1. detecting sharp wave ripples
2. detecting K-complex
3. detecting cortical up-down states
4. PCA based reactivation analysis
5. place cells bayesian decoding
6. representational complexity analysis

### To-Do

1. Covariance matrix obtained from z-scored population rate vectors within theta cycles throughout the RUN session, Pre-RUN and Post-RUN session
2. Recurring common co-activation patterns using the significant principal components (PCs) of the covariance matrix
